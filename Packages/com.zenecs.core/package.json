  "description": "ZenECS Core is a pure C# Entity–Component–System (ECS) runtime focused on determinism, clarity, and zero dependencies. It provides a minimal and composable foundation for data-driven gameplay and simulation logic, entirely independent of Unity. The Core layer contains only the runtime essentials — entity management, component storage, message bus, and system scheduling — making it suitable for both game engines and standalone .NET applications. It targets .NET Standard 2.1, supports serialization, snapshotting, and unit-test-friendly execution, and serves as the foundation for higher-level adapters such as Adapter.Unity, Adapter.Godot, or Adapter.WebGL.",
